# Tiny url inscale
 
Web application where a user can generate a short url for a given url.

## Introduction

In this project I implemented the backend of the familiar app - tiny url.

In this project I used Docker to run the images on containers, so make sure you have a version of docker installed on your computer.

Use this link [Docker install](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker.

There are 4 main flows to the project.
1) sign up
2) log in
3) create url
4) get url

For each flow there is an http request which will execute the API.

In order to make the http request you can use the Postman app or vsCode extension (request.rest).
